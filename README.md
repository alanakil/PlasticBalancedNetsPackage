# PlasticBalancedNetsPackage

## Package for Simulating a Plastic Balanced Network

The package `plastic_balanced_network` can be used to simulate spiking neural networks in the balance regime and undergoing synaptic plasticity on any cell type pair. 

There is a great deal of flexibility to simulate a network with any combination of the following parameters:
(1) Total number of neurons.
(2) Fraction of E-I neurons.
(3) Probability of connection.
(4) Synaptic strengths.
(5) Total time of simulation.
(6) Input rate and correlations.
(7) Extra injected current.
(8) EIF neuron parameters.
(9) Plasticity parameters on any connection type and plasticity type(Hebbian, Kohonen, homeostatic inhibitory plasticities).

To install this package, run `pip install plastic_balanced_network` in the terminal. 
Alternatively, clone the repo and run `pip install -e .` in the `Package` directory.
Import the package using: `import plastic_balanced_network`

## Original Simulations
Here we provide code for a series of simulations of plastic balanced networks. The results were reported in Akil et al. 2021 ("Balanced networks under spike-timing dependent plasticity"). Link to paper: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008958

We provide the MATLAB and Python code that was used for all simulations in Akil et al., 2021 in the folder named `original_simulations`.
In this code, we run several realizations of plastic balanced networks with varying: 

- Network size. To compare with theoretical predictions of rates, covariances, and synaptic weights.

- Input correlations. To assess the impact of increasing correlations in synaptic weights and rates.

- Initial connectivity. To show the emergence of a manifold of fixed points in weight space when only I->E synapses are plastic.

Please see more details in the paper Akil et al., 2021
